This is a **portfolio website** I created from scratch myself using Flask (a Python framework) and HTML.

Feel free to fork and use if you need to create yours.

I also find hosting it on **GitHub Pages** difficult. GitHub pages seem to only allow HTML-only websites so I went ahead and deploy it on **pythonanywhere.com**.

Although it is straightforward and easy to deploy on the website but if you need help doing that you can check out this Youtube video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75-oCKUx3oU.
