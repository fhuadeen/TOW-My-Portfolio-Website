  <h1 class="featurette-heading"> A bit about me:</h1>
  <ul class="list-group text-justify"">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <p>I like to see myself as someone who is generally business savvy with competent analytical skills. I enjoy working with data as I believe it helps in uncovering great information about any organisationâ€™s problem and how to solve such problems. I have been able to demonstrate a good level of problem-solving and leadership skills at my previous places of work in the past 3 years.</p>
      <p>I have worked at a number of places where I have been a good contributor to identifying and solving organisational problems in the areas of logistics, operations and leadership.</p>
      <p>Although I have worked in the area of operations and customer service earlier in my career, currently my focus is on building machine learning models and analysing business data that solve business problems.</p>
